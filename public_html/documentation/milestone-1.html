<h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
<p>Frank worked for various construction companies for 10 years. He took courses at night and got his contractors license and started his own business, Cook Remodeling, 5 years ago. The business has been steadily growing and Frank just hired 2 new workers to keep up with the demand. Last year, his oldest son, David, convinced him to set up web site and put together a simple site on godaddy.com. David keeps up the site but will be going away to college in a few months and Frank doesn't have the time or desire to learn how to keep up the site.</p>
<h2>Frustrations and Needs</h2>
<p>Frank has gotten a small number of leads through the website for some projects but he realizes that there is a lot more potential. He wants to hire someone who will redesign the website to look more professional. Other than more examples of his work and possibly customer satisfaction stories, he isn't sure what the website would need to generate traffic.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>At this time, Frank is not looking for a full time employee but needs someone who will be able to design the site, train his office manager for basic updates, and be available if there are any problems. He may reconsider as his business grows and if web maintenance becomes too much for his office manager.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a casual user, I need to be able to quickly determine if you can design a professional looking website that's simple to use.</p>
